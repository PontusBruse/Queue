In this assignment you are supposed to develop and test a multiple instance circular queue using a circular singly linked list to store and restore data of type int according to the requirements bellow:  
1. The module shall have a create function to create an instance
  - Size of a queue is passed to the create function and it shall be greater than 3
  - The nodes shall be created and linked in the create function
2. The module shall have a function to write data to a queue
  - If the queue is full then the oldest data shall be overwritten
3. The module shall have a function to read data from a queue
4. The module shall have a function to make a queue empty
5. The module shall have a function to return number of data elements stored in a queue
6. The module shall have a function to check if a queue is full or not
7. The module shall have a function to resize a queue
  - The new size shall also be greater than 3
  - In the case you need to delete nodes which hold data elements, nodes with the oldest data elements shall be deleted.
8. The module shall have a destroy function to release the allocated memory for an instance
9. The module shall be tested using assertion
10. There shall be a Makefile or a CMakeLists.txt file to build and run the test.
  - The generated files shall be stored in a directory named build
11. The submission shall be a zip file.  

To get G all the above requirements shall be fulfilled and to get VG the module shall be a well-designed and a well-described module.
